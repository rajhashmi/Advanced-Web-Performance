Resourse Discovery file

Cache Header per file

    * Absolute expiration date (1.0)
        when we send file to client we can set a time in header that when we want to expire this file till then save this file in browser Cache time like 25th april 2024 5:15 pm 
    
    * Relative expiration date (1.1);
        same but style of setting time is different like 12th month of 2024 
    

    browser needs a Resourse
 1] It check the cache 
    A] Cache MISS: we go the network
    B] Cache HIT:
        i] it's expired
           conditional request: 1) Not modified (Update cache header) 2) ok new file.
        ii] It's not expired
            we can use that file from the caches
