Backward/Forward cache 

have you wonder when we go back in the previous page for example from https://www.example.com/contact to https://www.example.com so when we go back it refresh for this the browser will again to to server and request that file but we can do one thing is to keep cache when we go Forward in page and when we go back in prevoius page instead of asking to the server it will take from cache
